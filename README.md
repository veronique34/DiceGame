### General Info

Rules of the game
The game includes 2 players on a single screen. 
Each player has a temporary score (ROUND) and an overall score (GLOBAL). 
Initially, the player has his/her ROUND initialized to 0.
He/she can roll a dice as many times as he/she wishes. 
The result of a throw is added to the ROUND.
Except that if the result is 1, the ROUND score is lost and his/her turn ends.


During his/her turn, the player can decide at any time to:

-Click on the "Hold" option, the ROUND points are added to the GLOBAL score. 
  It will then be the other player's turn.
-Roll the dice. 

The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game.
