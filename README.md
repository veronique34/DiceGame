# Project Dice Game
***************************************
### General Info
***
Rules of the game
The game includes 2 players on a single screen. 
Each player has a temporary score (ROUND) and an overall score (GLOBAL). 
initially, the player has his ROUND initialized to 0 
and can roll a dice as many times as he wishes. 
Except that if he/she rolls a 1, his ROUND score is lost and his turn ends.
The result of a throw is added to the ROUND.

During his turn, the player can decide at any time to:

Click on the "Hold" option, which sends the points of the ROUND to the GLOBAL. 
It will then be the other player's turn.
Roll the dice. 

The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game.
